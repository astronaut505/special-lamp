**Market timing**


  
**In conclusion,** it seems like I stumbled through the project like a clumsy panda trying to do calculus. I mean, who has the time and patience to calculate the EPS of every company in the index and then weigh them?  :rofl::rofl::rofl:

And let's not even get started on the out-of-sample method. it just doesn't make any sense. It's probably as accurate as a squirrel predicting the stock market.

In my defense, I decided to tackle these problems using symbolic calculations. You know, because why not add a touch of magical thinking to my already questionable methodology? Maybe I was hoping that the numbers would magically fall into place.

So, there you have it. My project was a mix of laziness, confusion, and a little bit of make-believe. If nothing else, at least it provided some comic relief. But at least, I beat the market, somehow...  :smirk:
